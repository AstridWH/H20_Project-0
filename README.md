# Excersice 1
 
- Have problems with exercise 4, factorial.
	It takes ages to run the test, and I have 
	no idea why. 
	P.S; I figured it out. Now I feel silly. 

- Exercise 3, sin can't take too high N. 85 seems
	to be the highest it can go. 

- Exersice 3, I button mashed for the test number,
	And accidentally found 5821 as a prime
	number. I know this isn't relevant, but
	it made me happy.
