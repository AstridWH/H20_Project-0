# Excersice 1
 
- Have problems with exercise 4, factorial.
	It takes ages to run the test, and I have 
	no idea why. 
	P.S; I figured it out. Now I feel silly. 

- Exercise 3, sin can't take too high N. 85 seems
	to be the highest it can go. 

- Exersice 3, I button mashed for the test number,
	And accidentally found 5821 as a prime
	number. I know this isn't relevant, but
	it made me happy. 

- Exercise 5: My biggest problem with this whole 
	thing is git and pytest. I've been coding
	in spyder, so I have very little experience
	with teminals, and I just can't get it to
	do what I want to to do. (eks, I created
	a branch called help while trying to 
	figure out how to move from in-progress
	to master)
	Update: I've gotten to master, but when 
	trying to pytest "Permission denied" comes 
	up.
- Just looked at github. Looks like it hasn't 
	registered master as a branch. Great.
